Instruction
==================================

The program is divided into two categories:
1)	The main work is in Java which comprises everything including some results - GUI
2)	The second aspect, LFSR key randomness analysis is in Python – GUI

Category 1.
I sent two files under this category
i.	Raw file in case you want to run and compile on your own. 
Note: you have to make sure all the libraries are present in your IDE (check the folder of number ii below and look for the “lib” folder for all the libraries)
To Run this unzip and put the folder in a location accessible to your IDE
Open Project from your IDE and locate and open 

ii.	Already compiled file in case you don’t want to run or compile the code. In other words, you just want to see results. 
Note: You must have some DICOM files (.DCM) to test this and the file does not need an installation process but you must have Java JDK – the ability to run Java file
Unzip the file look for the .JAR file inside the folder and double-click
		
Category 2.
This is just a Python file for LFSR key randomness testing. It is a GUI when you run it successfully.
•	You must have Python installed on your system and make sure you install a library called “Tkinter” for the GUI to work
•	Once the above is ready, open your Python IDE and run a file called “Main.py” It will open as shown in the Figure below.
•	Copy an LFSR key (Binary stream) from the Java application and paste it into this Python page. Select all the test parameters you want and generate results.
